A few programme ideas for learning vocabulary while watching series

I'm not a linguist so that's pretty naive but I wanted to take the full dictionnary and remove words as they appear in the series with a local file containing the unknown words.

This project is very messy and I did something bad with folders so there are errors.

I need to work on this project when I have time.
